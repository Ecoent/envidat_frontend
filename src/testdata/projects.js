            "description": "###Campaign Overview\r\n\r\nThe __RACLETS__ - _Role of Aerosols and CLouds Enhanced by Topography on Snow_ - campaign uniquely combines cloud and snow research to improve the understanding of precipitation formation in clouds and snow deposition on the ground.\r\n\r\nDuring the RACLETS campaign in February and March 2019, an extensive set of instruments was deployed in the Davos regions including aerosol, cloud, precipitation and snow measurements. In a unique cooperation between cloud and snow research groups, this study aimed to observe the complete life cycle of ice crystals:\r\n\r\n- Cloud droplet formation and ice nucleation on aerosol particles\r\n- Growth of cloud droplets and ice crystals to precipitation\r\n- Ice crystal enhancement by ice multiplication\r\n- Precipitation location and amount on the ground\r\n- Redistribution of snow on the ground\r\n\r\nThe measurements were contextualized by using regional numerical weather models for the atmosphere and high-resolution models for snow deposition.\r\n\r\nTo cover the spatial differences of the topography, instruments were deployed at six different locations and on a cable car. In __Davos Wolfang__, 1630 m above sea level (a.s.l.), [clouds](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets) were probed in-situ by a tethered balloon system, [radiosondes](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/meteorology) were launched, [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) was measured, [LIDAR and RADAR techniques](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) were applied and [aerosol and INP measurements](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/aerosols-raclets) were carried out to study the atmosphere.  \r\n\r\n[Snow](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) and [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) measurements were performed in __Laret__ which is located in the valley at an elevation of 1522 m a.s.l. and in a distance of about 6 km to Davos Wolfgang.\r\n\r\nThe mountain ridge __Gotschna__ separates Davos Wolfgang in the south from Klosters in the north. A cable car starts in Klosters (1170 m a.s.l.) and runs up to __Gotschnagrat__ (2285 m a.s.l.). HoloGondel was attached to the cable car, taking in-situ images of ice crystals and droplets in [clouds](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets). A [snow drift station](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) and a [disdrometer](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) were located at this summit too. \r\n\r\nA [ceilometer](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) was applied in __Klosters__ which is in the valley, north of Davos, at an elevation of 1170 m a.s.l.\r\nOne of the [weather stations](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/meteorology) of Meteoswiss is permanently mounted at the __Weissfluh__ at an elevation of 2840 m a.s.l.\r\n[Aerosols, INPs, CCNs](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/aerosols-raclets) as well as [snowflake](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) pictures and [snow measurements](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) were carried out at the a mountain site __Weissfluhjoch__ (2700 m a.s.l.).\r\n\r\n###Data Files\r\nThe data recorded during the campaign can be accessed via the following subprojects (as link): \r\n\r\n- [_Aerosols_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/aerosols-raclets)\r\n- [_Clouds in-situ_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/clouds-in-situ-raclets)\r\n- [_Meteorology_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/meteorology) \r\n- [_Modelling_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/modeling) \r\n- [_Precipitation_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/precipitation) \r\n- [_Remote Sensing_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/remote-sensing-raclets)\r\n- [_Snow_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/snow)\r\n\r\n\r\n###__Project Partners__\r\nMore information about participating insitutes can be found here: \r\n\r\n- https://duw.unibas.ch/de/home/\r\n- https://www.epfl.ch/en/home/\r\n- http://www.iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-physics.html\r\n- https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home.html?tab=overview\r\n- https://www.slf.ch/\r\n- https://www.tropos.de/institut/ueber-uns/das-institut/\r\n- https://www.wsl.ch/de/schnee-und-eis.html\r\n\r\n![An image is missing, e.g. picture Gotschnagrat, cablecar, Weissfluhjoch, etc.]()\r\n",

The test site below the building is the [SLF's](http://www.envidat.ch/organization/slf) oldest and equipped with numerous measuring instruments.\r\n\r\n## Globally unrivalled serial measurements\r\nIn autumn 1936, the Expert Commission for Snow and Avalanche Research (now the SLF) in Switzerland built the first snow laboratory on the Weissfluhjoch. Since these early days, SLF employees have been observing the weather and snow conditions on the adjacent test site daily. The site is located on a flat area of the Dorftälli, approximately 150 m below the Weissfluhjoch towards Davos, at an altitude of 2540 m. In view of the good accessibility and the numerous avalanche-prone slopes in the vicinity, researchers have conducted countless major experiments and studies here in the fields of snow mechanics, snow metamorphism, snow characterisation and measuring methodology. They have also tested the prototypes of various instruments, calibrated remote sensing products, and used the data collected at the test site to compare their snowpack models with those of other scholars.\r\nThe Weissfluhjoch test site is now the only one in the world at this altitude that has a daily record of snow depths and snowfall dating back more than 70 years.\r\n\r\n__More information:__ http://www.slf.ch/ueber/standorte/weissfluhjoch/index_EN",
