            "description": "Aerosol properties were measured at two stations during the [RACLETS](https://www.envidat.ch/group/edit/raclets-field-campaign) campaign. The first station was located in the valley at Davos Wolfang, at an elevation of 1630 m above sea level (a.s.l.), between lake Davos in the South and Laret in the North. The second measurement site was on a mountain site, called Weissfluhjoch, at an elevation of 2700 m a.s.l. The instruments were owned and operated by ETH Zurich and University of Basel. \r\n\r\nThe aerosol size spectra from 15 nm to 40 μm were recorded with a combination of SMPS (model 3310, TSI Inc.), APS (model 3321, TSI Inc.), and OPCs (OPC-N3, Alphasense ; GT-526S Met One Instruments, Inc.).\r\nIn-situ measurements of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) were carried out with a CCN chamber (CCNC, Droplet Measurement Technologies). Ice nucleating particle (INP) concentrations were measured by drop freezing experiments using LINDA (LED based Ice Nucleation Detection Aparatus, University of Basel), DRINCZ (Droplet Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich, ETH Zurich), and a cold stage. Information about the secondary ice fraction was gained by melting and re-freezing single dendrites. For further chemical analysis, particles larger than 0.5 um were collected with an air sampler (Coriolis micro, Bertin instruments) using a cyclone technology to separate particles from the air into the sample liquid.\r\n\r\n[HoloBalloon](https://www.envidat.ch/group/clouds-in-situ-raclets) and [radiosondes](https://www.envidat.ch/group/meteorology) were launched close to the aerosol measurement station in Davos Wolfgang. The OceaNet container hosting [remote sensing](https://www.envidat.ch/group/remote-sensing-raclets) instruments and a disdrometer to measure [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/precipitation) were placed in the same area.\r\n\r\n\r\n![pic not found](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/not%20uploaded/Jan/IMG_20190209_103151_scale.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n![pic not found](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/not%20uploaded/Claudia/IMG_8970_scale.JPG)",

HoloBalloon, a tethered balloon system, was launched at Davos Wolfgang at an elevation of 1630 m above sea level (a.s.l.) and ascended up to 800 m above ground. HoloGondel was mount on the upper section of the Gotschnabahn cable car, running between Gotschnaboden (1779 m a.s.l.) and Gotschnagrat (2285 m a.s.l.). \r\n\r\nBoth platforms were equipped with a holographic imager HOLIMO to measure the cloud microphysics. HOLIMO was used to image cloud particles in a size range between 6 um and 2 mm in a three-dimensional sample volume. Cloud droplets and ice crystals were discriminated above 25 µm based on the shape of their 2D shadowgraph. The products are phase resolved particle size distributions, concentrations, water contents and spatial distribution of the cloud particles. In addition to HOLIMO, the size distribution between 0.3 and 20 um was measured by an optical particle counter covering the larger aerosol particles and smallest cloud droplets in addition to [meteorological parameters](https://www.envidat.ch/group/meteorology) (temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure). \r\n\r\nInstruments to measure [aerosol concentrations](https://www.envidat.ch/group/aerosols-raclets), [meteorological parameters](https://www.envidat.ch/group/meteorology), [wind profiles/velocities](https://www.envidat.ch/group/remote-sensing-raclets), [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/precipitation) and the [CloudNet station](https://www.envidat.ch/group/remote-sensing-raclets) were close to the location where HoloBalloon and [radiosondes](https://www.envidat.ch/group/meteorology) were launched. \r\n\r\n![image missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/not%20uploaded/Annika/DSC_4601-2_Scale.jpg)\r\n\r\n![image missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/not%20uploaded/Annika/DSC_4605-2_Scale.jpg)\r\n\r\n![image missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/not%20uploaded/Annika/DSC_4674_Scale.jpg)\r\n\r\n![image missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/not%20uploaded/Annika/DSC_4704_scale.jpg)",

            "description": "### Campaign Overview\r\n\r\nThe __RACLETS__ - _Role of Aerosols and CLouds Enhanced by Topography on Snow_ - campaign uniquely combines cloud and snow research to improve the understanding of precipitation formation in clouds and snow deposition on the ground.\r\n\r\nDuring the RACLETS campaign in February and March 2019, an extensive set of instruments was deployed in the Davos regions including aerosol, cloud, precipitation and snow measurements. In a unique cooperation between cloud and snow research groups, this study aimed to observe the complete life cycle of ice crystals:\r\n\r\n- Cloud droplet formation and ice nucleation on aerosol particles\r\n- Growth of cloud droplets and ice crystals to precipitation\r\n- Ice crystal enhancement by ice multiplication\r\n- Precipitation location and amount on the ground\r\n- Redistribution of snow on the ground\r\n\r\nThe measurements were contextualized by using regional numerical weather models for the atmosphere and high-resolution models for snow deposition.\r\n\r\nTo cover the spatial differences of the topography, instruments were deployed at five different locations and on a cable car. The main measurement site was located in __Davos Wolfang__, 1630 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Here, [clouds](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets) were probed in-situ by a tethered balloon system (HoloBalloon), [radiosondes](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/meteorology) were launched, [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) was measured (disdrometer), [remote sensing instruments](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) were deployed (OceaNet station, Wind Profiler and Wind LIDAR) and [aerosol and INP measurements](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/aerosols-raclets) were carried out to study the atmosphere.  \r\n\r\nThe mountain ridge __Gotschna__ separates Davos Wolfgang in the south from Klosters in the north. In __Klosters__ (1170 m a.s.l.), a [ceilometer](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) was applied to measure the cloud base. On a cable car, running on the north side of the ridge towards __Gotschnagrat__ (2285 m a.s.l.), HoloGondel was attached, which took in-situ images of ice crystals and droplets in [clouds](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets). A [snow drift station](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) and a [disdrometer](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) were located at __Gotschnagrat__. \r\n\r\nAt the mountain site __Weissfluhjoch__ (2700 m a.s.l.), south of __Gotschna__, [Aerosols, INPs, CCNs](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/aerosols-raclets) were measured in addition to analysing [snowflakes](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) and performing [snow measurements](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow).\r\n\r\n[Snow](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) and [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) measurements were performed in __Laret__, which is located in the valley at an elevation of 1522 m a.s.l. and in a distance of about 1 km north of Davos Wolfgang.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Data Files\r\nThe data recorded during the campaign can be accessed via the following subprojects (as link): \r\n\r\n- [_Aerosols_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/aerosols-raclets)\r\n- [_Clouds in-situ_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/clouds-in-situ-raclets)\r\n- [_Meteorology_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/meteorology) \r\n- [_Modelling_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/modeling) \r\n- [_Precipitation_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/precipitation) \r\n- [_Remote Sensing_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/remote-sensing-raclets)\r\n- [_Snow_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/snow)\r\n\r\n\r\n### __Project Partners__\r\nMore information about participating insitutes can be found here: \r\n\r\n- https://duw.unibas.ch/de/home/\r\n- https://www.epfl.ch/en/home/\r\n- http://www.iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-physics.html\r\n- https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home.html?tab=overview\r\n- https://www.slf.ch/\r\n- https://www.tropos.de/institut/ueber-uns/das-institut/\r\n- https://www.wsl.ch/de/schnee-und-eis.html\r\n\r\n![An image is missing, e.g. picture Gotschnagrat, cablecar, Weissfluhjoch, etc.](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/staff/caroesch/images/2019-Poster-EGU%20RACLETS%20campaign_small-scaled5.png) \r\n",

                    "notes": "Switzerland has a reliable and cost efficient energy system. Due to phase  out of nuclear energy it is necessary to find new options to maintain this powerful energy system. The Swiss energy strategy 2050 aims to reduce CO2-emissions, increase efficiency and promote renewable energies. The Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) examined relevant woody and non-woody biomass quantities (cubic meters, fresh-, dry weight) and their energy potentials (in Petajoules: primary energy and biomethane) with a similar methodological approach. The work was done within the frame of the Swiss Competence Centers for Energy Research (SCCER) especially in line with the SCCER Biomass for Swiss energy future (Biosweet). With a uniform and consistent approach for the current potentials ten biomass categories were estimated and aggregated for the whole of Switzerland. In this context solutions for the technical, social and political challenges are promoted. First, considering the different biomass resources characteristics and available data, appropriate methods at the finest scale possible were elaborated to estimate the annual quantities which could theoretically be collected (theoretical potential). Then, explicit and rational restrictions for sustainable bio-energy production were defined according to the current state of the art and subtracted from the theoretical potential to obtain the sustainable potential. The main restrictions are competing material utilizations, environmental factors and supply costs. Finally, the additional sustainable potential was estimated considering the current bioenergy production. Our main purpose was to provide potentials for developing conversion technologies as well as a detailed and comprehensive basis of the Swiss biomass potentials for energy use for economic and political decision makers.

The experiment is located in a xeric mature Scots pine forest in the Pfynwald (46° 18' N, 7° 36' E, 615 m a.s.l.) in one of the driest inner-Alpine valleys of the European Alps, the Valais (mean annual temperature: 9.2°C, annual precipitation sum: 657 mm, both 1961-1990). Tree age is on average 100 years, the top height is 10.8 m and the stand density is 730 stems ha-1 with a basal area of 27.3 m2 ha-1. The forest is described as _Erico Pinetum sylvestris_ and the soil is a shallow pararendzina characterized by low water retention. The experimental site (1.2 ha; 800 trees) is split up into eight plots of 1'000 m2 each. During April-October, irrigation is applied on four randomly selected plots with sprinklers of 1 m height at night using water from an adjacent water channel. The amount of irrigation corresponds to a supplementary rainfall of 700 mm year-1. Trees in the other four plots grow under naturally dry conditions. Soil moisture has been monitored since the beginning of the project at 3 soil depths (10, 20 and 60 cm). The crown condition of each tree is being assessed each year since 2003. Tree measurement data such as diameter at breast height, tree height, and social status were assessed in 2002, 2009 and 2014. The duration of the irrigation experiment is planned for 20 years.",

                    "notes": "Decomposition of plant litter is a key process for the transfer of carbon and nutrients in ecosystems. Carbon contained in the decaying biomass is released to the atmosphere as respired CO2, and may contribute to global warming. Litterbag studies have been used to improve our knowledge of the drivers of litter decomposition, but they lack comparability because litter quality is plant species-specific. The use of commercial tea bags as a standard substrate was suggested in order to harmonize studies, where green tea and rooibos represent more labile and more recalcitrant C compounds as surrogates of local litter.\r\nThe tea bag approach was implemented on eight sites of the Swiss long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) network (https://www.wsl.ch/LWF). This allowed us to take advantage from the existing infrastructure and data from a previous litterbag study with local litter. In Beatenberg and Schaenis, additional elevation transects were established (1200-1800 m and 540-1150 m, respectively) to examine particularly the effect of temperature on decomposition. In Pfynwald (https://www.wsl.ch/de/ueber-die-wsl/versuchsanlagen-und-labors/flaechen-im-wald/pfynwald.html) and Salgesch, infrastructure of running projects was used to examine the effect of drought and understory removal, respectively. In Novaggio, tea bags were incubated in summer and winter to study the effect of seasonality particularly precipitation. Tea bags are collected after 3, 12, 24, and 36 months; for the two time-shifted experiments additionally after 6 and 9 months.\r\nThe study has two primary objectives. Firstly, it contributes to TeaComposition initiative (http://teacomposition.org/) which aims at investigating long-term litter decomposition and its key drivers at present as well as under different future climate scenarios using a common protocol and standard litter (tea) across nine terrestrial biomes. Secondly, the data are used to further develop decomposition models such as Yasso (http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/yasso) which is used by several countries, including Switzerland to estimate the annual carbon fluxes in dead wood, litter, and soil for reporting in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.\r\n",

The test site below the building is the [SLF's](http://www.envidat.ch/organization/slf) oldest and equipped with numerous measuring instruments.\r\n\r\n## Globally unrivalled serial measurements\r\nIn autumn 1936, the Expert Commission for Snow and Avalanche Research (now the SLF) in Switzerland built the first snow laboratory on the Weissfluhjoch. Since these early days, SLF employees have been observing the weather and snow conditions on the adjacent test site daily. The site is located on a flat area of the Dorftälli, approximately 150 m below the Weissfluhjoch towards Davos, at an altitude of 2540 m. In view of the good accessibility and the numerous avalanche-prone slopes in the vicinity, researchers have conducted countless major experiments and studies here in the fields of snow mechanics, snow metamorphism, snow characterisation and measuring methodology. They have also tested the prototypes of various instruments, calibrated remote sensing products, and used the data collected at the test site to compare their snowpack models with those of other scholars.\r\nThe Weissfluhjoch test site is now the only one in the world at this altitude that has a daily record of snow depths and snowfall dating back more than 70 years.\r\n\r\n__More information:__ http://www.slf.ch/ueber/standorte/weissfluhjoch/index_EN",

The experimental site at the Weissfluhjoch (WFJ, 46.83 N, 9.81 E) is located at an altitude of 2540 m in the Swiss Alps near Davos. During the winter months, almost all precipitation falls as snow at this altitude. As a consequence, a continuous seasonal snow cover builds up every winter, with a maximum snow height ranging from 153–366 cm over the period 1934–2012. The measurement site is located in an almost flat part of a southeast oriented slope.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n1. Marty, C., Philipona, R., Frohlich, C., Ohmura, A..
